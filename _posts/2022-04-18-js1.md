# [Day 1. Introduction][1]

> On `day 1`, I learned the basics of the basics of JavaScript. I wrote some notes on my notebook, and this post will contain features that I think are important to remember.

![header image TIL](../assets/images/til.jpg)

## 1. console.log()

+ can take multiple arguments
+ the arguments are strings(texts)
  + single quotes(' '), double quotes(" "), back-ticks(``)

## 2. Comments

+ single line comment
```js
// this is a single line comment.
```

+ multiline comment
```js
/*
you can put multiple lines of comments,
using these symbols.
*/
```

## 3. Arithmetics

On console(how to open:`Ctrl+Shift+I`), I can use these operators without `console.log`, but in text editor I should use `console.log`.

+ multiplication(*)
+ division(/)
+ addition(+)
+ subtraction(-)
+ modulus(%) - finding remainder
+ exponentation(**) ex) 3 ** 2 = 9

## 4. Adding Javascript to a web page

### 1) Inline script

```html
<body>
  <button onclick = "alert('Welcome!')">Click me<button>
</body>
  ```

### 2) Internal script
  + could be written in both head/**body**

```html
<script>
  console.log('Welcome!');
</script>
```

### 3) External script *(create an external JavaScript file)*
  + could be written in both head/**body**
  
```html
<body>
  <script src = "introduction.js"></script>
</body>
```
+ before the closing tag(`</body>`) is recommended place to put JavaScript code

### 4) Multiple external scripts
  + you can add several JS files
  + ⚠️your main.js file should be **below** all other scripts(should be written last)

## 5. Introduction to Data Types

### Primitive Types

+ Numbers - both integers(-,0,+) and float-point numbers
+ Strings - any data types under ' ', " ", ``
+ Boolean - true / false
+ undefined 
    + default value if we don't assign any value to a variable
    + if a function is not returning anything, it returns undefined
+ null - an empty value

<br>

## 6. Variables

### To declare a variable

A variable is a container of data. It stores the memory data of the location.
When a variable is declared, the memory space is reserved. When the variable is assigned to a value(= a data), the memory space is filled.

To declare variable, we can use `var`, `let`, and `const`.
`var` is not recommended, `let` is for variables that changes at a different time, and `const` is for datat that doesn't change at all(e.g. PI, gravity).

### Variable naming rules

The name of a variable...
+ doesn't begin with number
+ doesn't allow special characters except $ and _
+ follows a camelCase convention(cf. CamelCase for declaring classes)
+ doesn't have space between words

```js
/* 
'=' is called an assignment operator,
and the value is called an assigned data.
*/
let nameOfVariable = value;
```

+ Variables can be declared in one line seperated by comma, but it's recommended to use a seperate line to make the code more readable.
