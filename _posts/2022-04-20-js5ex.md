# Day 5. [Arrays_Exercise][1]

## ðŸ‘ŸLevel 1.
##### 5) Declare an array called mixedDataTypes, put different data types in the array and find the length of the array. The array size should be greater than 5.
```js
const mixedDataTypes = [
    'Vanya', 
    7,
    true,
    'white violin', 
    'Hargreeves', 
    { umbrella_academy: ['number 1', 'number 2', 'number 3', 'number 4', 'number 5', 'number 6', 'number 7'] } 
];
console.log(mixedDataTypes.length);  //6
```

<br>

##### 9) Print the first company, middle and last company.
```js
const itCompanies = ['Facebook', 'Google', 'Microsoft', 'Apple', 'IBM', 'Oracle', 'Amazon'];
console.log(itCompanies[0], itCompanies[3], itCompanies[6]);  //Facebook Apple Amazon
```
I was doing a silly thing... I tried to print them out with `itCompanies.index[0]`. Probably, I thought it as some kind of array method. It doesn't work.

> To access an item of an array, use `array[indexNum]`

```js
let middle = (itCompanies.length - 1) / 2;
let last = itCompanies.length - 1;
console.log(itCompanies[0], itCompanies[middle], itCompanies[last]);  //Facebook Apple Amazon
```
This worked out too.

<br>

##### 10) Print out each company.
```js
const itCompanies = ['Facebook', 'Google', 'Microsoft', 'Apple', 'IBM', 'Oracle', 'Amazon'];
console.log(itCompanies.toString());  //Facebook,Google,Microsoft,Apple,IBM,Oracle,Amazon
console.log(itCompanies.join(' '));  //Facebook Google Microsoft Apple IBM Oracle Amazon
```
I first thought 'OK, Let's split the array!' but the truth is `split()` is for strings. Instead, I used `toString` to print out each company's name. Then I used `join` to space out each names.

> `toString` doesn't have any parameters by default. If I want to seperate the items of an array as a string, use `join`!

<br>

##### 11) Change each company name to uppercase one by one and print them out.

```js
const itCompanies = ['Facebook', 'Google', 'Microsoft', 'Apple', 'IBM', 'Oracle', 'Amazon'];
itCompanies[0] = itCompanies[0].toUpperCase();
itCompanies[1] = itCompanies[1].toUpperCase();
itCompanies[2] = itCompanies[2].toUpperCase();
itCompanies[3] = itCompanies[3].toUpperCase();
itCompanies[4] = itCompanies[4].toUpperCase();
itCompanies[5] = itCompanies[5].toUpperCase();
itCompanies[6] = itCompanies[6].toUpperCase();
console.log(itCompanies);  //(7)Â ['FACEBOOK', 'GOOGLE', 'MICROSOFT', 'APPLE', 'IBM', 'ORACLE', 'AMAZON']
```
> The items of an array are mutable(modifiable)! I only have to reassign a value.

<br>

##### 12) Print the array like as a sentence: Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Apple, IBM, Oracle and Amazon are big IT companies.

```js
const itCompanies = ['Facebook', 'Google', 'Microsoft', 'Apple', 'IBM', 'Oracle', 'Amazon'];
itCompanies[6] = 'and Amazon';
console.log(`${itCompanies.join(', ')} are big IT companies.`);
```

I'm not sure if modifying the last element of an array would be the best way, but it worked out. If you have any ideas, please comment below!

<br>

##### 13) Check if a certain company exists in the itCompanies array. If it exist return the company else return a company is not found.
```js
//using includes()
let company = prompt('What company do you want to find?');
let inclusion = itCompanies.includes(company);
if (inclusion === true) {
    console.log(company);
} else {
    console.log(`${company} is not found.`);
};

//using indexOf()
let company = prompt('What company do you want to find?');
let inclusion = itCompanies.indexOf(company);
if (inclusion === -1) {
    console.log(`${company} is not found.`);
} else {
    console.log(company);
};
```

I made a prompt so that the user can enter a company name. `includes()` returns true or false, so I made a condition about it. I can also use `indexOf()`. `indexOf()` returns the index if the value exists, or else it would return -1.

<br>

##### 14) Filter out companies which have more than one 'o' without the filter method.

```js
const itCompanies = ['Facebook', 'Google', 'Microsoft', 'Apple', 'IBM', 'Oracle', 'Amazon'];
let pattern = /o/gi;
let size = itCompanies[0].match(pattern).length; 
console.log(size);  //2 
console.log(itCompanies[1].match(pattern).length);  //2
console.log(itCompanies[2].match(pattern).length);  //2
console.log(itCompanies[3].match(pattern).length);  //error(null)
console.log(itCompanies[4].match(pattern).length);  //error(null)
console.log(itCompanies[5].match(pattern).length);  //1
console.log(itCompanies[6].match(pattern).length);  //1
//'Facebook', 'Google', 'Microsoft', 'Oracle', 'Amazon' 
```
I wanted to set another variable of index and make it loop through the index numbers, but for now I'm not sure how it works. So, I set a regular expression and used `match()` to determine if the element of the array has more than one 'o's. The variable `size` will return the number of 'o's that each element has. If I learn how to set a loop, I could set a condition(`if (size >= 1)`) and get the elements printed.<br>

To make the code shorter, I used `console.log()` from index 1 to 6. But at index 3 and 4, the array from `match(pattern)` was null. So the length of that array couldn't be printed, hence error. However, the goal to this problem was to filter the elements, so I think I did the job. If there's any better way, please comment below!

<br>

##### 18) Slice out the last 3 companies from the array.
```js
console.log(itCompanies.slice(4, 6));  //(2)Â ['IBM', 'Oracle']
console.log(itCompanies.slice(4));  //(3)Â ['IBM', 'Oracle', 'Amazon']
```

> Remember, slice doesn't include the ending position. If I want to slice from starting point to the end, the argument for the ending position should be empty so that it could be included.

<br>

##### 19) Slice out the middle IT company or companies from the array.
```js
console.log(itCompanies.slice(1,6));  //(5)Â ['Google', 'Microsoft', 'Apple', 'IBM', 'Oracle']
console.log(itCompanies.slice(2,5));  //(3)Â ['Microsoft', 'Apple', 'IBM']
console.log(itCompanies.slice(3,4));  //['Apple']
```
I wonder if I could make 'the middle' into some calculation, making the computer do the work.

<br>

#####23) Remove all IT companies.
```js
console.log(itCompanies.splice());  //[]
```
> `splice()` is used to remove all the items of an array.

<br>

## ðŸ‘ŸLevel 2.
##### 1) Create a separate countries.js file and store the countries array in to this file, create a separate file web_techs.js and store the webTechs array in to this file. Access both file in main.js file.

To solve this one, I tracked myself back to [Day 1][2], when I was learning how to add JavaScript to a web page. I made a folder '30DaysOfJS', and created three js files(countries.js, web_techs.js, main.js) and one HTML file(index.html). I stored each arrays at countries.js and web_techs.js. Then, on the index.html I added JavaScript files with `<script>` tag. If I open the page of index.html, I can access to both arrays in countries.js and web_techs.js.

```html
<body>
    <script src = "countries.js"></script>
    <script src = "web_techs.js"></script>
    <script src = "main.js"></script>
</body>
```
> The `main.js` file should be below all the other scripts!

<br>

##### 2) First remove all the punctuations and change the string to array and count the number of words in the array.
```js
let text = 'I love teaching and empowering people. I teach HTML, CSS, JS, React, Python.';
//removing all the punctuations
let string = text.replace(/[^\w ]/g, '');
//change the string to array
let arr = string.split(' ');
//count the number of words in the array
console.log(arr.length);  //13
```

I've done similar task at [Day 2][4]. Still, I didn't fully understand why I should put space after `\w`, so I asked stackoverflow and got the [answer][3]. The `^` means 'not', so `[^\w ]` will remove everything except the character classes listed in the bracket(in this case, a word character and a space).

> Don't forget the syntax! Regular expressions starts and ends with delimiters(/), and between them are the things that I want to find or match. After the ending delimiter, I can put `g`(for global search), or `i`(for case-insensitive search).

To change the string to an array, I used `split()`, which was at Day 2. It splits a string at a specified place. In this case I put `' '`(a space) at the argument, so the string will be splitted at the spaces.

<br>

##### 3) In the following shopping cart add, remove, edit items.

```js
const shoppingCart = ['Milk', 'Coffee', 'Tea', 'Honey'];
```

+ Add 'Meat' in the beginning of your shopping cart if it has not been already added

```js
const shoppingCart = ['Milk', 'Coffee', 'Tea', 'Honey'];
if (shoppingCart.includes('Meat') === false) {
    shoppingCart.unshift('Meat');
    console.log(shoppingCart);
};  //(5)Â ['Meat', 'Milk', 'Coffee', 'Tea', 'Honey']
```
At first I set the condition like `if (!(shoppingCart.includes('Meat'))`, but it didn't work out. Making a condition, I should check if *a returned value matches certain value*.

> `includes()` is a method used both in strings and arrays. Remember that `includes()` returns me a Boolean value!

<br>

+ Add 'Sugar' at the end of you shopping cart if it has not been already added.

```js
const shoppingCart = ['Milk', 'Coffee', 'Tea', 'Honey']
if ((shoppingCart.includes('Sugar')) === false) {
    shoppingCart.push('Sugar');
    console.log(shoppingCart);
};  //(5)Â ['Milk', 'Coffee', 'Tea', 'Honey', 'Sugar']
```
<br>

+ Remove 'Honey' if you are allergic to honey.

```js
const shoppingCart = ['Milk', 'Coffee', 'Tea', 'Honey']
//the second argument in the prompt will act as a placeholder
let allergyInput = prompt('Are you allergic to honey?', 'Enter Y or N');
if (allergyInput === 'Y') {
    //starting from index 3, remove 1 item
    shoppingCart.splice(3, 1);
    console.log(shoppingCart);
}; //(3)Â ['Milk', 'Coffee', 'Tea']
```

<br>

+ Modify 'Tea' to 'Green Tea'.

```js
const shoppingCart = ['Milk', 'Coffee', 'Tea', 'Honey'];
//starting from index 2, remove 1 item, add(replace) it to 'Green Tea'
shoppingCart.splice(2, 1, 'Green Tea');
console.log(shoppingCart);  //(4)Â ['Milk', 'Coffee', 'Green Tea', 'Honey']
```

> `splice()` is used for both removing and replacing items of an array. To replace an item is to remove the item and add a new item.

<br>

##### 4) In countries array check if 'Ethiopia' exists in the array if it exists print 'ETHIOPIA'. If it does not exist add to the countries list.

```js
const countries = [
  'Albania',
  'Bolivia',
  'Canada',
  'Denmark',
  'Ethiopia',
  'Finland',
  'Germany',
  'Hungary',
  'Ireland',
  'Japan',
  'Kenya'
];
if (countries.includes('Ethiopia') === true) {
    console.log('ETHIOPIA');
} else {
    countries.unshift('Ethiopia');
};  //ETHIOPIA
```
I used `unshift()`, but I think using `push()` could also be possible. The only difference will be the position to which 'Ethiopia' is added - at the beginning for `unshift()`, and at the end for `push()`. Below I checked if the code works by removing 'Ethiopia' from the array.

```js
const countries = [
  'Albania',
  'Bolivia',
  'Canada',
  'Denmark',
  'Finland',
  'Germany',
  'Hungary',
  'Ireland',
  'Japan',
  'Kenya'
];
if (countries.includes('Ethiopia') === true) {
    console.log('ETHIOPIA');
} else {
    countries.unshift('Ethiopia');
};
console.log(countries);  //'Ethiopia' is added at the beginning of the array
```

<br>

##### 5) In the webTechs array, check if 'Sass' exists in the array and if it exists print 'Sass is a CSS preprocess'. If it does not exist, add 'Sass' to the array and print the array.

```js
const webTechs = [
  'HTML',
  'CSS',
  'JavaScript',
  'React',
  'Redux',
  'Node',
  'MongoDB'
];
if (webTechs.includes('Sass') === true) {
    console.log('Sass is a CSS preprocess.');
} else {
    webTechs.push('Sass');
    console.log(webTechs);
};  //(8)Â ['HTML', 'CSS', 'JavaScript', 'React', 'Redux', 'Node', 'MongoDB', 'Sass']
```

Below I checked if the code works by adding 'Sass' in the array.
```js
const webTechs = [
  'HTML',
  'CSS',
  'JavaScript',
  'React',
  'Redux',
  'Node',
  'MongoDB',
  'Sass'
];
if (webTechs.includes('Sass') === true) {
    console.log('Sass is a CSS preprocess.');
} else {
    webTechs.push('Sass');
    console.log(webTechs);
};  //Sass is a CSS preprocess.
```
<br>

##### 6) Concatenate the following two variables and store it in a fullStack variable.

```js
const frontEnd = ['HTML', 'CSS', 'JS', 'React', 'Redux']
const backEnd = ['Node','Express', 'MongoDB']

console.log(fullStack)
```

```js
const frontEnd = ['HTML', 'CSS', 'JS', 'React', 'Redux'];
const backEnd = ['Node','Express', 'MongoDB'];
const fullStack = frontEnd.concat(backEnd);
console.log(fullStack);
```
I cannot concatenate two arrayss like `concat(frontEnd, backEnd)`. This syntax only works for strings, where `concat()` takes several substrings as its arguments and joins them.

<br>

## ðŸ‘ŸLevel 3.
##### 1) The following is an array of 10 students ages:

```js
const ages = [19, 22, 19, 24, 20, 25, 26, 24, 25, 24]
```
+ Sort the array and find the min and max age.

```js
const ages = [19, 22, 19, 24, 20, 25, 26, 24, 25, 24];
let sortedAges = ages.sort();
console.log(`min: ${sortedAges[0]}, max: ${sortedAges[sortedAges.length - 1]}`);
//min: 19, max: 26
```
After the sorting, the array's first item would be min, and the last item max. I used `sortedAges[sortedAges.length - 1]` to get the value of the last index. I used string literals to print out the returned values.

```js
const ages = [19, 22, 19, 24, 20, 25, 26, 24, 25, 24];
let sortedAges = ages.sort();
console.log(Math.min(...sortedAges));  //19
console.log(Math.max(...sortedAges));  //26
```

For another approach, I wanted to use `Math.min()` and `Math.max()`, but I couldn't log the returned value when I put the code like `Math.min(ages)`. It returned `NaN`(Not a Number) all the time.

I wondered if there's a way that I could use the math object, so I looked up [the MDN document][5] of `Math.min()`. On the top of the page is the syntax of the method, and I found out that **I should add three dots before the name of an array.** I think those three dots indicate that the following name is an array.

Though, using `Math.min()` and `Math.max()` would make the sorting process unnecessary.

<br>

+ Find the median age(one middle item or two middle items divided by two).

From this question, I realized that to get the middle item(or items), I should have used division of the length of an array.

```js
