# Day 5. [Arrays_Exercise][1]

## ðŸ‘ŸLevel 1.
**5) Declare an array called mixedDataTypes, put different data types in the array and find the length of the array. The array size should be greater than 5**
```js
const mixedDataTypes = [
    'Vanya', 
    7,
    true,
    'white violin', 
    'Hargreeves', 
    { umbrella_academy: ['number 1', 'number 2', 'number 3', 'number 4', 'number 5', 'number 6', 'number 7'] } 
];
console.log(mixedDataTypes.length);  //6
```

<br>

**9) Print the first company, middle and last company.**

```js
const itCompanies = ['Facebook', 'Google', 'Microsoft', 'Apple', 'IBM', 'Oracle', 'Amazon'];
console.log(itCompanies[0], itCompanies[3], itCompanies[6]);  //Facebook Apple Amazon
```
I was doing a silly thing... I tried to print them out with `itCompanies.index[0]`. Probably, I thought it as some kind of array method. It doesn't work.

> To access an item of an array, use `array[indexNum]`!

```js
let middle = (itCompanies.length - 1) / 2;
let last = itCompanies.length - 1;
console.log(itCompanies[0], itCompanies[middle], itCompanies[last]);  //Facebook Apple Amazon
```
This worked out too.

<br>

**10) Print out each company.**
```js
const itCompanies = ['Facebook', 'Google', 'Microsoft', 'Apple', 'IBM', 'Oracle', 'Amazon'];
console.log(itCompanies.toString());  //Facebook,Google,Microsoft,Apple,IBM,Oracle,Amazon
console.log(itCompanies.join(' '));  //Facebook Google Microsoft Apple IBM Oracle Amazon
```
I first thought 'OK, Let's split the array!' but the truth is `split()` is for strings. Instead, I used `toString` to print out each company's name. Then I used `join` to space out each names.

> `toString` doesn't have any parameters by default. If I want to seperate the items of an array as a string, use `join`!

<br>

**11) Change each company name to uppercase one by one and print them out.**

```js
const itCompanies = ['Facebook', 'Google', 'Microsoft', 'Apple', 'IBM', 'Oracle', 'Amazon'];
itCompanies[0] = itCompanies[0].toUpperCase();
itCompanies[1] = itCompanies[1].toUpperCase();
itCompanies[2] = itCompanies[2].toUpperCase();
itCompanies[3] = itCompanies[3].toUpperCase();
itCompanies[4] = itCompanies[4].toUpperCase();
itCompanies[5] = itCompanies[5].toUpperCase();
itCompanies[6] = itCompanies[6].toUpperCase();
console.log(itCompanies);  //(7)Â ['FACEBOOK', 'GOOGLE', 'MICROSOFT', 'APPLE', 'IBM', 'ORACLE', 'AMAZON']
```
> The items of an array are mutable(modifiable)! I only have to reassign a value.

<br>

**12) Print the array like as a sentence: Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Apple, IBM, Oracle and Amazon are big IT companies.**

```js
const itCompanies = ['Facebook', 'Google', 'Microsoft', 'Apple', 'IBM', 'Oracle', 'Amazon'];
itCompanies[6] = 'and Amazon';
console.log(`${itCompanies.join(', ')} are big IT companies.`);
```

I'm not sure if modifying the last element of an array would be the best way, but it worked out. If you have any ideas, please comment below!

<br>

**13) Check if a certain company exists in the itCompanies array. If it exist return the company else return a company is not found.**
```js
//using includes()
let company = prompt('What company do you want to find?');
let inclusion = itCompanies.includes(company);
if (inclusion === true) {
    console.log(company);
} else {
    console.log(`${company} is not found.`);
};

//using indexOf()
let company = prompt('What company do you want to find?');
let inclusion = itCompanies.indexOf(company);
if (inclusion === -1) {
    console.log(`${company} is not found.`);
} else {
    console.log(company);
};
```

I made a prompt so that the user can enter a company name. `includes()` returns true or false, so I made a condition about it. I can also use `indexOf()`. `indexOf()` returns the index if the value exists, or else it would return -1.

<br>

**14) Filter out companies which have more than one 'o' without the filter method.**

```js
const itCompanies = ['Facebook', 'Google', 'Microsoft', 'Apple', 'IBM', 'Oracle', 'Amazon'];
let pattern = /o/gi;
let size = itCompanies[0].match(pattern).length; 
console.log(size);  //2 
console.log(itCompanies[1].match(pattern).length);  //2
console.log(itCompanies[2].match(pattern).length);  //2
console.log(itCompanies[3].match(pattern).length);  //error(null)
console.log(itCompanies[4].match(pattern).length);  //error(null)
console.log(itCompanies[5].match(pattern).length);  //1
console.log(itCompanies[6].match(pattern).length);  //1
//'Facebook', 'Google', 'Microsoft', 'Oracle', 'Amazon' 
```
I wanted to set another variable of index and make it loop through the index numbers, but for now I'm not sure how it works. So, I set a regular expression and used `match()` to determine if the element of the array has more than one 'o's. The variable `size` will return the number of 'o's that each element has. If I learn how to set a loop, I could set a condition(`if (size >= 1)`) and get the elements printed.<br>

To make the code shorter, I used `console.log()` from index 1 to 6. But at index 3 and 4, the array from `match(pattern)` was null. So the length of that array couldn't be printed, hence error. However, the goal to this problem was to filter the elements, so I think I did the job. If there's any better way, please comment below!

<br>

**18) Slice out the last 3 companies from the array.**
```js
console.log(itCompanies.slice(4, 6));  //(2)Â ['IBM', 'Oracle']
console.log(itCompanies.slice(4));  //(3)Â ['IBM', 'Oracle', 'Amazon']
```

> Remember, slice doesn't include the ending position. If I want to slice from starting point to the end, the argument for the ending position should be empty so that it could be included.

<br>

**19) Slice out the middle IT company or companies from the array.**
```js
console.log(itCompanies.slice(1,6));  //(5)Â ['Google', 'Microsoft', 'Apple', 'IBM', 'Oracle']
console.log(itCompanies.slice(2,5));  //(3)Â ['Microsoft', 'Apple', 'IBM']
console.log(itCompanies.slice(3,4));  //['Apple']
```
I wonder if I could make 'the middle' into some calculation, making the computer do the work.

<br>

**23) Remove all IT companies.**
```js
console.log(itCompanies.splice());  //[]
```
> `splice()` is used to remove all the items of an array.

<br>

## ðŸ‘ŸLevel 2.
**1) Create a separate countries.js file and store the countries array in to this file, create a separate file web_techs.js and store the webTechs array in to this file. Access both file in main.js file.**

To solve this one, I tracked myself back to [Day 1][2], when I was learning how to add JavaScript to a web page. I made a folder '30DaysOfJS', and created three js files(countries.js, web_techs.js, main.js) and one HTML file(index.html). I stored each arrays at countries.js and web_techs.js. Then, on the index.html I added JavaScript files with `<script>` tag. If I open the page of index.html, I can access to both arrays in countries.js and web_techs.js.

```html
<body>
    <script src = "countries.js"></script>
    <script src = "web_techs.js"></script>
    <script src = "main.js"></script>
</body>
```
> The `main.js` file should be below all the other scripts!
