# Further Study: reduce()

Solving some exercises, I found it hard to get the idea of using `reduce()`. Either the explanation in 30DaysOfJs or the MDN Document didn't help me, so I decided to study more about the method.
<br>

## Understanding the concept
+ ["JavaScript Array Reduce"][1]

`reduce()` takes two arguments: 1) a callback function with two parameters: accumulator and current value, 2) the initial value for the accumulator(optional but recommended - the default value is set to the value of first index).<br>

The callback function is executed multiple times, and each time the current value will be set to one element in the array, moving forwards. So each call, I'll get the current value and execute the function. Internally, the reducer will get the result of the function and store it in the accumulator. Finally, it returns a single value, and I can store it in a variable.<br>

So to simply put, `reduce()` takes two parameters, executes a function on those parameters, and the result from the function becomes one of the parameters on the next round. The accumulator is continuously set to the value after the callback function is executed. The reducer starts with an accumulator, and looping through the array, converts all the elements into a single value.<br>


```js
//without initialization, adding all the elements of numbers array
const sum = numbers.reduce(
  (accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue
);
```
