# Day 8. [Objects_Exercise][1]


[Level 1][6]  /  [Level 2][7]  /  [Level 3][8]

<br>

## ðŸ‘ŸLevel 1.
##### 1) Create an empty object called dog.

```js
const dog = {};
```
<br>

##### 2) Print the the dog object on the console.

```js
console.log(dog);  //{}
```

<br>

##### 3) Add name, legs, color, age and bark properties for the dog object. The bark property is a method which return woof woof.

```js
const dog = {
  name: 'Toby',
  legs: 4,
  color: 'brown',
  bark: () => 'woof woof'
}

console.log(dog);  //{name: 'Toby', legs: 4, color: 'brown', bark: Æ’}
console.log(dog.bark());  //woof woof
```
<br>

Or, I can just put the key-value pair right into the object I made before.
```js
const dog = {};

dog.name = 'Toby';
dog.legs = 4;
dog.color = 'brown';
dog.bark = () => 'woof woof'

console.log(dog);  //{name: 'Toby', legs: 4, color: 'brown', bark: Æ’}
```

I wanted to use an arrow function, but at first I put it in the wrong way like `function = () => 'woof woof'`. An arrow function uses an arrow instead of the `function` keyword, so the syntax was wrong.<br>

> An object method is a function inside an object.

<br>

##### 4) Get name, legs, color, age and bark value from the dog object.

```js
console.log(Object.values(dog));  //(4)Â ['Toby', 4, 'brown', Æ’]
```

<br>

##### 5) Set new properties the dog object: breed, getDogInfo.

```js
const dog = {
  name: 'Toby',
  legs: 4,
  color: 'brown',
  bark: () => 'woof woof'
}

dog.breed = 'bulldog';
dog.getDogInfo = function() {
  let statement = `This dog is ${this.name}. He has ${this.legs} legs. He is ${this.color}, and he barks ${this.bark()}.`
  return statement;
}

console.log(dog.getDogInfo());  //This dog is Toby. He has 4 legs. He is brown, and he barks woof woof.
```

<br>

## ðŸ‘ŸLevel 2.

```
const users = {
  Alex: {
    email: 'alex@alex.com',
    skills: ['HTML', 'CSS', 'JavaScript'],
    age: 20,
    isLoggedIn: false,
    points: 30
  },
  Asab: {
    email: 'asab@asab.com',
    skills: ['HTML', 'CSS', 'JavaScript', 'Redux', 'MongoDB', 'Express', 'React', 'Node'],
    age: 25,
    isLoggedIn: false,
    points: 50
  },
  Brook: {
    email: 'daniel@daniel.com',
    skills: ['HTML', 'CSS', 'JavaScript', 'React', 'Redux'],
    age: 30,
    isLoggedIn: true,
    points: 50
  },
  Daniel: {
    email: 'daniel@alex.com',
    skills: ['HTML', 'CSS', 'JavaScript', 'Python'],
    age: 20,
    isLoggedIn: false,
    points: 40
  },
  John: {
    email: 'john@john.com',
    skills: ['HTML', 'CSS', 'JavaScript', 'React', 'Redux', 'Node.js'],
    age: 20,
    isLoggedIn: true,
    points: 50
  },
  Thomas: {
    email: 'thomas@thomas.com',
    skills: ['HTML', 'CSS', 'JavaScript', 'React'],
    age: 20,
    isLoggedIn: false,
    points: 40
  },
  Paul: {
    email: 'paul@paul.com',
    skills: ['HTML', 'CSS', 'JavaScript', 'MongoDB', 'Express', 'React', 'Node'],
    age: 20,
    isLoggedIn: false,
    points: 40
  }
}
```
<br>

##### 1) Find the person who has the most skills in the users object.

```js
console.log(users.Alex.skills.length);  //3
```
I thought this way, I could loop the object and print the array in the form of  [userName, numberOfSkills].
<br>

```js
let userIds = Object.keys(users);  //(7)Â ['Alex', 'Asab', 'Brook', 'Daniel', 'John', 'Thomas', 'Paul']
for (let i = 0; i < userId.length; i++) {
  let userIds = Object.keys(users);
  let userSkills = users.userIds[i].skills;
  console.log(userIds, userSkills);
}
```
It didn't work out. There was an error to `userID` that it couldn't read 0. I guess it is because `userId[i]` doesn't come across as Alex, but 'Alex' as a string.<br>

The `users` object is composed of another 7 objects by the username, each containing 5 keys(or properties) with a value. What I want to print out is the object name, and the length of `skill` value of that object.
<br>

I couldn't figure out why it wouldn't work, so I asked [stackoverflow][3]. From the comments, I could learn that **I cannot use dot notation with variables**. Instead, I should have used bracket notation to detect a string-named property. Here's a nice article about the topic: [Dot notation vs Brackets?][2] and [the MDN Document][4] about property accessors.
<br>

```js
//get arrays of [userName, numbers of skills] separately
let userIds = Object.keys(users); 
for (let i = 0; i < userIds.length; i++) {
  let userSkills = [userIds[i], users[userIds[i]].skills.length];
  console.log(userSkills);
}
//(2)Â ['Alex', 3], (2)Â ['Asab', 8], (2)Â ['Brook', 5],...(2)Â ['Paul', 7]


//get the same array as an array of arrays
let userIds = Object.keys(users);
let userSkills = [];
for (let i = 0; i < userIds.length; i++) {
  userSkills[i] = [userIds[i], users[userId[i]].skills.length];
}
console.log(userSkills);
//(7)Â [Array(2), Array(2),... Array(2)]
//[['Alex', 3], ['Asab', 8],...['Paul', 7]]
```
<br>

To only get the username who has most skills, I set the max number of skills length. Then I printed out the username who has the max number of skills.

```js
//just get the username who has most skills
let userIds = Object.keys(users);
let userSkills = [];
for (let i = 0; i < userIds.length; i++) {
  userSkills[i] = users[userIds[i]].skills.length;
}
const max = Math.max(...userSkills);
for (let i = 0; i < userIds.length; i++) {
  if (userSkills[i] == max) {
    console.log(userIds[i]);
  }
}
//Asab
```
At the code above, I first wrote the condition as `userSkills[i] = max` and wondered why all the usernames are printed. `=` is an assignment operator, so all the elements of `userSkills` became the max number.
 
> `=` and `==`/`===` are different! Let's be aware of that.

<br>

##### 2) Count logged in users, and count users having greater than equal to 50 points from the following object.

```js
let userIds = Object.keys(users);
let countLoggedIn = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < userIds.length; i++) {
  if (users[userIds[i]].isLoggedIn == true) {
    countLoggedIn++;
  }
}
console.log(countLoggedIn);  //2
```

<br>

##### 3) Find people who are MERN stack developer from the users object.

A MERN developer should have 'MongoDB', 'Express', 'React', 'Node' in their skill property. 

```js
let mernDev = [];
let userIds = Object.keys(users);
for (let i = 0; i < userIds.length; i++) {
  let skills = users[userIds[i]].skills
  if (skills.includes('MongoDB') && skills.includes('Express') && skills.includes('React') && skills.includes('Node')) {
    mernDev.push(userIds[i]);
  }
}
console.log(`MERN Developers: ${mernDev.join(', ')}`);
//MERN Developers: Asab, Paul
```

<br>

##### 4) Set your name in the users object without modifying the original users object.

```js
users.Ramona = {
  email: 'ramona@ramona.com',
  skills: ['HTML', 'CSS', 'JavaScript'],
  age: 23,
  isLoggedIn: true,
  points: 30
}
```

<br>

##### 5) Get all keys or properties of users object.

```js
console.log(Object.keys(users));
//(7)Â ['Alex', 'Asab', 'Brook', 'Daniel', 'John', 'Thomas', 'Paul']
```
<br>
For the case that the quiz was asking for all the keys, including the keys inside the keys, I wrote the code down below. Since all the keys from each user was the same, I just put `userids[0]` to specify one key.

```js
let userIds = Object.keys(users);
let userKeys = Object.keys(users[userIds[0]]);
const allKeys = userIds.concat(userKeys);
console.log(allKeys);
//(12)Â ['Alex', 'Asab', 'Brook', 'Daniel', 'John', 'Thomas', 'Paul', 'email', 'skills', 'age', 'isLoggedIn', 'points']
```

<br>

##### 6) Get all the values of users object.

```js
console.log(Object.values(users));
//return an array that has 7 object elements, each containing five key-value pairs
```
<br>
Again, for the case that the quiz was asking for all the values, including the keys inside the keys, I wrote the code down below.

```js
let userIds = Object.keys(users);
const userValues = [];
for (let i = 0; i < userIds.length; i++) {
  userValues.push(Object.values(users[userIds[i]]));
}
console.log(userValues);
//return an array with 5 array elements, each containing the values of user information
```

<br>

##### 7. Use the [countries object][5] to print a country name, capital, populations and languages.

Since the countries array is an array of objects, I had to set another array variable to consider each element object as an object. 

```js
for (let i = 0; i < countries.length; i++) {
  let name = countries[i]['name'];
  let capital = countries[i]['capital'];
  let population = countries[i]['population'];
  let languages = countries[i]['languages'];
  console.log(`${name}, ${capital}, ${population}, ${languages}`);
}
```
At first I thought I I had to set another array variable to consider each element object as an object. But soon I realized that it wasn't needed. I could just use an array index, and only print the values of name, capital, populations, and languages keys.

<br>


## ðŸ‘ŸLevel 3.
##### 1) Create an object literal called personAccount. It has firstName, lastName, incomes, expenses properties and it has totalIncome, totalExpense, accountInfo, addIncome, addExpense and accountBalance methods. Incomes is a set of incomes and its description and expenses is a set of incomes and its description.

```js
```
