# Day 6. [Loops_Exercise][1]

## üëüLevel 1.
##### 1) Iterate 0 to 10 using for loop, do the same using while and do while loop.

```js
for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}

let i = 0;
while (i <= 10) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}

let i = 0;
do {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
} while (i <= 10);
```

<br>

##### 2) Iterate 10 to 0 using for loop, do the same using while and do while loop.


```js
for (let i = 10; i >= 0; i--) {
  console.log(i);
}

let i = 10;
while (i >= 0) {
  console.log(i);
  i--;
}

let i = 10;
do {
  console.log(i);
  i--;
} while (i >= 0);
```
> I don't need semicolons at `if else`, `for loop` or `while`. I do need one after `do...while`.


<br>

##### 3) Iterate 0 to n using for loop.

```js
let n = 15;
for (let i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```
If I want to return the values, I have to declare the variable `n`.

<br>

##### 4) Write a loop that makes the following pattern using console.log():

```
  #
  ##
  ###
  ####
  #####
  ######
  #######
```
```js
let string = '#';
for (let i = 1; i <= 6 ; i++) {
    console.log(string.repeat(i));
}
```
I struggled with this one, wondering how could I print the '#'s according to the variable `i`. I first did some things like `console.log('#' * i)` but it sure didn't work and returned NaN(because a string and a number cannot be multiplied). I came up with an idea that I could use `repeat()` from string method, and it worked.

> `repeat()` takes a number as argument and it returns the repeated version of the string.

<br>


##### 5) Use loop to print the following pattern:

```
0 x 0 = 0
1 x 1 = 1
2 x 2 = 4
3 x 3 = 9
4 x 4 = 16
5 x 5 = 25
6 x 6 = 36
7 x 7 = 49
8 x 8 = 64
9 x 9 = 81
10 x 10 = 100
```
```js
for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
  console.log(`${i} x ${i} = ${i*i}`);
}
```
> Don't forget to end your string template with a back-tick(`)!

<br>

##### 5) Use loop to print the following pattern:

```
 i    i^2   i^3
 0    0     0
 1    1     1
 2    4     8
 3    9     27
 4    16    64
 5    25    125
 6    36    216
 7    49    343
 8    64    512
 9    81    729
 10   100   1000
```
```js
console.log(`i\ti^2\ti^3`);
for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
  console.log(`${i}\t${i ** 2}\t${i ** 3}`);
}
```
<br>

##### 7) Use for loop to iterate from 0 to 100 and print only even numbers.

```js
for (let i = 0; i <= 100; i++) {
  if (i % 2 == 0) {
  console.log(i);
  }
}
```
```js
for (let i = 0; i <= 100; i++) {
  if (i % 2 != 0) {
    continue;
  }
  console.log(i);
}
```

I made a condition evaluating if the number is an even number, and printed out the values that matches the condition.

> Using `continue()`, I can skip the iteration of odd numbers.

<br>

##### 8) Use for loop to iterate from 0 to 100 and print only odd numbers.

```js
for (let i = 0; i <= 100; i++) {
  if (i % 2 != 0) {
  console.log(i);
  }
}
```
```js
for (let i = 0; i <= 100; i++) {
  if (i % 2 == 0) {
    continue;
  }
  console.log(i);
}
```

<br>

##### ‚ö†Ô∏è9) Use for loop to iterate from 0 to 100 and print only prime numbers.

```js
```

<br>

##### 10) Use for loop to iterate from 0 to 100 and print the sum of all numbers.

```js
const numbers = [];
let sum = 0;
for (let i = 0; i <= 100; i++) {
  numbers.push(i);
  sum += numbers[i]
}
console.log(sum);  //5050
```
> I can put several statements in a block when using `for loop`. Let's shorten the code and make it as readable as possible!

<br>

##### 11) Use for loop to iterate from 0 to 100 and print the sum of all evens and the sum of all odds.

```
The sum of all evens from 0 to 100 is 2550. And the sum of all odds from 0 to 100 is 2500.
```

```js
let sumEvens = 0;
let sumOdds = 0;
for (let i = 0; i <= 100; i++) {
  if (i % 2 == 0) {
    sumEvens += i;
  } else {
    sumOdds += i;
  }
}
console.log(`The sum of all evens from 0 to 100 is ${sumEvens}. And the sum of all odds from 0 to 100 is ${sumOdds}.`);  //The sum of all evens from 0 to 100 is 2550. And the sum of all odds from 0 to 100 is 2500.  
```

<br>

##### 12) Use for loop to iterate from 0 to 100 and print the sum of all evens and the sum of all odds. Print sum of evens and sum of odds as array.

```
 [2550, 2500]
```

```js
let sumEvens = 0;
let sumOdds = 0;

for (let i = 0; i <= 100; i++) {
  if (i % 2 == 0) {
    sumEvens += i;
  } else {
    sumOdds += i;
  }
}
const sumArr = [];
sumArr.push(sumEvens, sumOdds);
console.log(sumArr);  //[2550, 2500]
```
It was quite hard to grasp the idea on this task, but somehow I got on the way. First, I set a variable to store each sum of even numbers and odd numbers. Then, I used `for loop` and `if else` to get the sums of both even and odd numbers. Then, I merged those two sums into one array called `sumArr` and logged it on the console.

<br>

##### 13) Develop a small script which generate array of 5 random numbers.

```js
const randNum = Array(5);
//fill the array with random number between 0 and 10
randNum.fill(Math.floor(Math.random() * 11));
console.log(randNum);  //(5)¬†[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
```
I first thought that the array would be filled by 5 different values, but it turned out that `Math.random()` only assigns one value, and `fill()` would fill all the elements with that same value.

<br>

##### 14) Develop a small script which generate array of 5 random numbers and the numbers must be unique.

```js
const randNum = [];
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  randNum[i] = Math.floor(Math.random() * 11);
}
console.log(randNum);  //(5)¬†[0, 10, 1, 0, 9]
```
To assign unique values to each elements, I used `for loop` to execute the `Math.random()` method at each index number.

<br>

##### 15) Develop a small script which generate a six characters random id:

```
5j2khz
```
```js
let abc = 'abcdefghijklmnopqstuvwxyz0123456789';
const id = [];
for (let i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
    id[i] = abc.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random()*(abc.length+1)));
}
console.log(id.join(''));  //3awg9v
```
I first thought of using [ASCII code][3], cause the numbers were assigned to each character. But the range of the numbers and lowercase word characters was separated, so I had to find another way. Iwasn't sure how to get a random character, so I googled it and got the idea from [stackoverflow][2].<br>

The key idea is to use `charAt()` string method and `join()` array method. I set a string called `abc` which contained all lowercase characters and numbers. and I randomly accessed to the character through the index, using `Math.random()`. `Math.floor()` floors the number so that the random number wouldn't have any numbers after the decimal point.<br>

If I hadn't used `join()`, the array of single characters would be returned. So, to make the array into string and to make the elments attached, I used `join()` and put ''(no space) for the parameter.

<br>


## üëüLevel 2.
##### 1) Develop a small script which generate any number of characters random id:

```
fe3jo1gl124g  /  xkqci4utda1lmbelpkm03rba
```
```js
let abc = 'abcdefghijklmnopqstuvwxyz0123456789';
const id = [];
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    id[i] = abc.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random()*(abc.length+1)));
}
console.log(id.join(''));
```
The only difference of this task from the previous one is that the number of times that `for loop` is executed should be set random.

<br>

##### 2) Write a script which generates a random hexadecimal number.
```
'#ee33df'
```

<br>

##### 3) Write a script which generates a random rgb color number.

```
rgb(240,180,80)
```

<br>

##### 4) Using the above countries array, create the following new array.

```
["ALBANIA", "BOLIVIA", "CANADA", "DENMARK", "ETHIOPIA", "FINLAND", "GERMANY", "HUNGARY", "IRELAND", "JAPAN", "KENYA"]
```

<br>

##### 5) Using the above countries array, create an array for countries length'.

```
[7, 7, 6, 7, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 5, 5]
```

<br>

##### 6) Use the countries array to create the following array of arrays:

```
[
  ['Albania', 'ALB', 7],
  ['Bolivia', 'BOL', 7],

  ['Ethiopia', 'ETH', 8],
  ['Finland', 'FIN', 7],
  ['Germany', 'GER', 7],
  ['Hungary', 'HUN', 7],
  ['Ireland', 'IRE', 7],
  ['Iceland', 'ICE', 7],
  ['Japan', 'JAP', 5],
  ['Kenya', 'KEN', 5]
]
```

<br>

##### 7) In above countries array, check if there is a country or countries containing the word 'land'. If there are countries containing 'land', print it as array. If there is no country containing the word 'land', print 'All these countries are without land'.

```
['Finland','Ireland', 'Iceland']
```

<br>

##### 8) In above countries array, check if there is a country or countries end with a substring 'ia'. If there are countries end with, print it as array. If there is no country containing the word 'ai', print 'These are countries ends without ia'.

```
['Albania', 'Bolivia','Ethiopia']
```

<br>

##### 9) Using the above countries array, find the country containing the biggest number of characters.

<br>

##### 10) Using the above countries array, find the country containing only 5 characters.

<br>

##### 11) Find the longest word in the webTechs array.

<br>

##### 12) Use the webTechs array to create the following array of arrays:

<br>

##### 13) An application created using MongoDB, Express, React and Node is called a MERN stack app. Create the acronym MERN by using the array mernStack.

<br>

##### 14) Iterate through the array, ["HTML", "CSS", "JS", "React", "Redux", "Node", "Express", "MongoDB"] using a for loop or for of loop and print out the items.

<br>

##### 15) This is a fruit array , ['banana', 'orange', 'mango', 'lemon'] reverse the order using loop without using a reverse method.

<br>

##### 16) Print all the elements of array as shown below.

<br>

##### 5) Find the country containing the hightest number of characters in the countries array.

<br>

##### 6) Extract all the countries contain the word 'land' from the countries array and print it as array.

<br>

##### 7) Extract all the countries containing only four characters from the countries array and print it as array.

<br>
