# [Day 6. Loops][1]

# Loops

## 1. [for Loop][10]
```js
for(initialization; condition; increment or decrement;){
  // code goes here
}
```

To use a `for Loop`, I need three parameters. First I have to initialize a value(a value to start with). Then I have to set a condition. The loop will execute as long as the condition is true. Usually the condition sets the number of times the loop is executed. Lastly, I have to put increment(++) or decrement(--) operator so that the loop will start from initialized value and run the code.

```js
for (let i = 5, i >= 0, i--) {
  console.log(i);
}
```
On the upper code, the parameters inside `for` would mean "let `i` start from 5. As long as `i` is greater or equal to 0, run the code while decrementing `i` by one at each execution of the code."


+ **Adding all elements in the array**

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let sum = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    sum = sum + numbers[i];  //sum += numbers[i];
}
console.log(sum);
```

If I want to add up all the elements, I should declare a new variable for storing the added number(`sum`). As the `i` is incremented by each iteration, the elements of `numbers` will be added to `sum` through all its indexes.
About `sum += numbers[i]`, I learned it at [Day 2 Assignment operators][3]. Remember that the arithmetic operator comes before the equal sign.

I can use this method to add through, say 1 to 10.

```js
let sum = 0;
for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
  sum += i  //same as, sum = sum + i
}
console.log(sum);  //55
```

+ **Creating a new array based on the existing array**

```js
for(let i = 0; i <= 5; i++){
  console.log(`${i} * ${i} = ${i * i}`)
}
```
> Using a string template, I can add expressions by using `${}`. Those expressions could be a value, some operations like comparision, arithmetic operation, or ternary operation.

```js
const countries = ['Finland', 'Sweden', 'Denmark', 'Norway', 'Iceland'];
const newArr = [];
for (let i = 0; i < countries.length; i++){
  newArr.push(countries[i].toUpperCase());
}
```
One thing to notice is that the index number starts from zero. So, if I want to run the loop through all the index numbers, I have to initialize `i` to zero, and should not include the ending index(< not <=). 
On the upper code, `push()` was used to fill the `newArr`. It adds a new element at the end of an array, so the new elements could be stored in the same order. I thought `fill()` could work the same, but it didn't work. By the way, here's [an article][2] I found about how to fill an array in JavaScript. The code above used the third method, 'using the push() method in combination with for loop.'

## 2. [while Loop][4]

```js
while (condition) {
  statement
  }
```
```js
let i = 0
while (i <= 5) {
  console.log(i)
  i++
}

// 0 1 2 3 4 5
```
The while statement is executed as long as the condition evaluates to true(execute the statement as long as `i <= 5` is true). **The condition is evaluated before executing the statement**.

If the condition evaluates to false, the statement is not executed, and code runs after the while loop. Use block statement({}) if there are multiple statements. I can initialize the value before the while loop.

<br>

## 3. [do... while Loop][5]

```js
do {
   statement
} while (condition);
```
```js
let i = 0
do {
  console.log(i)
  i++
} while (i <= 5);

// 0 1 2 3 4 5
```

The while statement is executed until the condition evaluates to false(execute the statement as long as `i <= 5` is true).
 
The difference of `while loop` and `do while loop` is that **the condition is evaluated after the statement**, so at least the statement is executed once. In `while loop`, the statement won't be executed at all if the condition is false. But in `do while loop` the statement will still be executed at first even if the condition evaluates to false.

<br>

## 4. [for...of Loop][6]

```js
for (const element of arr) {
  // code goes here
}
```

I can use `for...of loop` for a loop iterating over iterable objects, including string or array(and more). It is useful when I'm not interested in the index of each element in the array. I think `for...or loop` is a good way to declare a variable in an array and return values related, without caring the index numbers.

```js
const webTechs = [
  'HTML',
  'CSS',
  'JavaScript',
  'React',
  'Redux',
  'Node',
  'MongoDB'
];
for (const tech of webTechs) {
  console.log(tech[0]) // get only the first letter of each element,  H C J R N M
}
```
<br>


## 5. [break][7]
I've seen this one when I was learning about conditionals-[switch][8]. Simply put, the `break` literally breaks a loop. It stops and interrupt a code from further execution.

```js
for(let i = 0; i <= 5; i++){
  if(i == 3){
    break;  //stop the loop if `i` is 3
  }
  console.log(i);
}

// 0 1 2
```
The upper code will execute the iteration until `i` reaches 3. If `i` is equal to 3, it will terminate the loop and move on to the following statement.


<br>

## 6. [continue][9]
It is used to skip a certain iterations. `continue()` terminates execution of the statements in the current iteration of the loop, and continues executing loop with the next iteration.

```js
for (let i = 0; i <= 5; i++) {
  if (i == 3){
    continue;  //skip the execution when `i` is 3
  }
  console.log(i)
}

// 0 1 2 4 5
```
