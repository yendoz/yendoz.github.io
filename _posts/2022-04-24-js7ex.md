# Day 7. [Functions_Exercise][1]

> The exercises are all for writing codes by myself. I think the best thing of this course is that it provides a lot of exercise quizzes. Let's start problem solving!


+ [Level 1][2]
+ [Level 2][3]
+ [Level 3][4]


## üëüLevel 1.
##### 1) Declare a function fullName and it print out your full name.

```js
function printFullName() {
  let firstName = 'Jane';
  let lastName = 'Doe';
  let space = ' ';
  let fullName = firstName + space + lastName;
  return fullName;
}

printFullName();  //'Jane Doe'
console.log(printFullName());  //Jane Doe
```

I first declared a function without any parameter. If I just print the function using `printFullName()`, the value is returned with single quotes. If I put `console.log()`, it would just return the value.

<br>

##### 2) Declare a function fullName and now it takes firstName, lastName as a parameter and it returns your full name.

```js
function printFullName(firstName, lastName) {
  return `${firstName} ${lastName}`;
}

console.log(printFullName('Jane', 'Doe'));
```

<br>

##### 3) Declare a function addNumbers and it takes two parameters and it returns sum.

```js
//function declaration
function addNumbers(numOne, numTwo) {
  return numOne + numTwo;
}

console.log(addNumbers(7, 16)); 

//arrow funcition
const addNumbers = (numOne, numTwo) => numOne + numTwo;
console.log(addNumbers(5, 3));
```
<br>

##### 4) An area of a rectangle is calculated as follows: area = length x width. Write a function which calculates areaOfRectangle.

```js
//function declaration
function areaOfRectangle(length, width) {
  return length * width;
}

//arrow function
const areaOfRectangle = (length, width) => length * width;
```

<br>

##### 5) A perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as follows: perimeter= 2x(length + width). Write a function which calculates perimeterOfRectangle.

```js
function perimeterOfRectangle(length, width) {
  return 2 * length * width;
}

const perimeterOfRectangle = (length, width) => 2 * length * width;
```
<br>

##### 6) A volume of a rectangular prism is calculated as follows: volume = length x width x height. Write a function which calculates volumeOfRectPrism.

```js
function volumeOfRectPrism(length, width, height) {
  return length * width * height;
}

const volumeOfRectPrism = (length, width, height) => length * width * height;
```

<br>

##### 7) Area of a circle is calculated as follows: area = œÄ x r x r. Write a function which calculates areaOfCircle.

```js
//function declaration
function areaOfCircle(r) {
  return Math.PI * r * r;
}

console.log(areaOfCircle(10));  //314.159265...
console.log(areaOfCircle(10).toFixed(0));  //314

//arrow function
const areaOfCircle = (r) => Math.PI * r * r;
```
If I want to round the number so that the number has no decimal number, I can use `toFixed()`. Inside the parentheses I can put the number of decimal point that I want.

<br>


##### 8) Circumference of a circle is calculated as follows: circumference = 2œÄr. Write a function which calculates circumOfCircle.

```js
function circumOfCircle(r) {
  return 2 * Math.PI * r;
}

const circumOfCircle = (r) =>  2 * Math.PI * r;
```

<br>

##### 9) Density of a substance is calculated as follows: density = mass/volume. Write a function which calculates density.

```js
function density(mass, volume) {
  return mass / volume ;
}

const density = (mass, volume) => mass / volume;
```
<br>

##### 10) Speed is calculated by dividing the total distance covered by a moving object divided by the total amount of time taken. Write a function which calculates a speed of a moving object, *speed*.

```js
function speed(distance, time) {
  return distance / time ;
}

const speed = (distance, time) => distance / time;
```

<br>

##### 11) Weight of a substance is calculated as follows: weight = mass x gravity. Write a function which calculates weight.

```js
function weightOfObject(mass, gravity = 9.81) {
  let weight = mass * gravity;
  return weight;
}

const weightOfObject = (mass, gravity = 9.81) => mass * gravity;
```

<br>

##### 12) Temperature in oC can be converted to oF using this formula: oF = (oC x 9/5) + 32. Write a function which convert oC to oF convertCelsiusToFahrenheit.

```js
function convertCelsiusToFahrenheit(oC) {
  let farenheit = (oC * 9/5) + 32;
  return farenheit;
}

const convertCelsiusToFahrenheit = (oC) => (oC * 9/5) + 32;
```

<br>

##### 13) Body mass index(BMI) is calculated as follows: bmi = weight in Kg / (height x height) in m2. Write a function which calculates bmi. BMI is used to broadly define different weight groups in adults 20 years old or older.Check if a person is underweight, normal, overweight or obese based the information given below.

+ The same groups apply to both men and women.
+ Underweight: BMI is less than 18.5
+ Normal weight: BMI is 18.5 to 24.9
+ Overweight: BMI is 25 to 29.9
+ Obese: BMI is 30 or more

```js
let yourBmi = (function calculateBmi() {
  let weight = prompt('Enter your weight in Kg');
  let height = prompt('Enter your height in M');
  let bmi = weight / (height * height);
  return bmi;
})();

switch (true) {
  case yourBmi < 18.5 :
    console.log('Underweight');
    break;
  case yourBmi < 24.9 :
    console.log('Normal weight');
    break;
  case yourBmi < 29.9 :
    console.log('Overweight');
    break;
  default:
    console.log('Obese');
}
```
To use `switch` to log various results depending on the BMI, I had to set a new variable to store the data of a function. About using switch, I once had [similar quiz][5] before at day 4.<br>

I wanted the user to input the arguments, so I made a function without any parameters. And to make the function invoke itself without being called, I used [self invoking functions][6], putting parentheses around the function. The function doesn't need any parameters, so I just put empty parentheses after the parentheses around the function, to make it execute. If I don't put another parentheses after the function it wouldn't work.

> In JavaScript, a ‚ÄúSelf-Invoking‚Äù function is a type of function that is invoked or called automatically after its definition. The execution of such an anonymous function is done by enclosing it in a parenthesis set followed by another set of parenthesis.

<br>

##### 14) Write a function called checkSeason, it takes a month parameter and returns the season : Autumn, Winter, Spring or Summer.

This one is similar to the previous task, but the function has to return the season, so I put `switch()` inside the function. 

```js
(function checkSeason() {
  let month = prompt('What month is it now?', 'Enter a number.');
  switch (month) {
    case '3': case '4': case '5':
      console.log('Spring');
      break;
    case '6': case '7': case '8':
      console.log('Summer');
      break;
    case '9': case '10': case '11':
      console.log('Autumn');
      break;
    //same as case '12': case '1': case '2': 
    default: 
      console.log('Winter');
      break;
  }
})();
```
By the way, using pipe operator(||) between each cases won't work. The cases should be written separately. I can put an enter to each cases to make it more readable, but to shorten the code I just put multiple cases in one line.

<br>

```js
(function checkSeason() {
  let month = prompt('What month is it now?', 'Enter a number.');
  if(month == '3' || '4' || '5') {
    return 'Spring';
  } else if (month == '6' || '7' || '8') {
    return 'Summer';
  } else if (month == '9' || '10' || '11') {
    return 'Autumn';
  } else {
    return 'Winter';
  }
})();
```
The upper code is what I've tried at first. I tried to shorten the code by using `if else if else`, and put `return` in the place of `console.log()`. It wouldn't work. No matter what number I put in, the result was always 'Spring'. <br>

I searched if there is a way of returning multiple values in a function. I found out the upper code wouldn't work because **the `return` statement would stop the execution of the function**. So basically the function always ended at the `return 'Spring'`.<br>

So I changed all the `return` statement into `console.log()`, but it didn't work. It had the same problem as I had at [this one][7]. I realized that putting multiple values with the pipe operator won't work. I changed the condition like below, and it worked.

```js
(function checkSeason() {
  let month = prompt('What month is it now?', 'Enter a number.');
  if(month == '3' || month == '4' || month == '5') {
    console.log('Spring');
  } else if (month == '6' || month == '7' || month == '8') {
    console.log('Summmer');
  } else if (month == '9' || month == '10' || month == '11') {
    console.log('Autumn');
  } else {
    console.log('Winter');
  }
})();
```
<br>

##### 15. Math.max returns its largest argument. Write a function findMax that takes three arguments and returns their maximum without using Math.max method.

```js
function findMax(num1, num2, num3) {
  if (num1 >= num2) {
    if (num1 >= num3) {
      console.log(num1);
    } else {
      console.log(num3);
    }
  } else {
    if (num2 >= num3) {
      console.log(num2);
    } else {
      console.log(num3);
    }
  }
}

console.log(findMax(5, -6, 9));  //9
```

To find the largest argument without using `Math.max` method, I put a bunch of `if else` in the function to manually compare the values of an argument. However, I thought there could be a better way. The code seemed unnecessaily long. After googling, I got an idea from [stackoverflow][8].

<br>

```js
function findMax(num1, num2, num3) {
  const arr = [num1, num2, num3];
  let maxNum = arr[0]
  for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    if (maxNum <= arr[i]) {
      maxNum = arr[i]
    }
  }
  return maxNum;
}

console.log(findMax(4, -30, 7));  //7
```
At first I wanted to somehow number the parameter like an index, but I couldn't find out how. So, I made an array composed of three parameters, and used `for loop` to run through each element of the array, compare the value, and replace the largest number(`maxNum`) if there's a larger number in the argument. Please comment below if you have any idea about improving my code! 

<br>

I can expand the code into the case where there's unlimited number of arguments, using `arguments` object like below. I think using `for loop` would be more efficient as the number of arguments increases.

```js
function findMax() {
  let maxNum = arguments[0];
  for (let i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) {
    if (maxNum <= arguments[i+1]) {
      maxNum = arguments[i+1]
    }
  }
  return maxNum;
}

console.log(findMax(1, 5, -9, 70, 8, 64));  //70
```
First, I set the variable of largest number(`maxNum`) to the first element of arguments. Then, the `for loop` will run through each element of arguments, and for each loop the larger number would survive.<br>

At first I set the condition `if (arguments[i] <= arguments[i+1])1, but it wouldn't work the right way. To return the largest value from the argument, the number being compared should be the largest number, not the value before.

<br>

## üëüLevel 2.
##### 1) Linear equation is calculated as follows: ax + by + c = 0. Write a function which calculates value of a linear equation, solveLinEquation.

```js
function solveLinEqution
```
